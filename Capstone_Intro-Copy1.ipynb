    "The objective of the business problem was to help stakeholders identify one of the safest borough in Vancouver, and an appropriate neighborhood within the borough to set up a commercial establishment especially a Grocery store. This has been achieved by first making use of Vancouver crime data to identify a safe borugh with considerable number of neighborhood for any business to be viable. After selecting the borough it was imperative to choose the right neighborhood where grocery shops were not among venues in a close proximity to each other. We achieved this by grouping the neighborhoods into clusters to assist the stakeholders by providing them with relavent data about venues and safety of a given neighborhood.\n"

    "We have explored the crime data to understand different types of crimes in all neighborhoods of Vancouver and later categorized them into different boroughs, this helped us group the neighborhoods into boroughs and choose the safest borough first. Once we confirmed the borough the number of neighborhoods for consideration also comes down, we further shortlist the neighborhoods based on the common venues, to choose a neighborhood which best suits the business problem.\n",
